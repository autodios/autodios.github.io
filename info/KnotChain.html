    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Art is political. This is a statement has permeated the imaginary of both artists and aesthetes, either by embracing it, or fervently questioning it. From Ingmar Bergman, making a parallel in between art, politics, and ethics, to Toni Morrison, who affirmed that the best art is political and beautiful at the same time, art, as long as it delves in the social, on issues related community as culture, is understood to be political.  

The current censoring of artists voicing opinions that do not sit well with certain powers, plus the placing of strategic figures (sometimes more linked with governments than art itself) in positions that can shape the trends of the art world, not only according to the taste of local governments, art dealers, or an sponsoring elite, but to seemingly specific global agendas, pressure us artists to acknowledge that abstaining for viewing our art as political, echoing Simone de Beauvoir, is a political act on itself.  

Although the linking of art and politics has been an open discussion for some time now, few artists have actually been as audacious as to recognized the political as an art on itself. For Joseph Beuys, the controversial German artist and known ex-Nazi, the concept of art had expanded to such a degree that it had colonized the separate realms of science and politics, and this was not surprising as “the scientific was originally contained in the artistic.” In fact, Beuys was convinced that “humankind will not survive without having realized the social body, the social order, into a kind of artwork.” Any of us could reshape society “as a sculpture,” that is, as art. Thus, everyone could be a politician-as-artist, as doing politics would be an art on itself.  

Yet critique has also been strong for the co-founder of the German green party and the creator of that “Social sculpture” concept: for Benjamin Buchloh, Beuys “misconception that politics could become a matter of aesthetics” fulfils the criteria for “the totalitarian in art.” This would be clearly expressed in Beuys following statement: 

 

“How I actually bring it as theory to the totalized concept of art, which means everything. The totalized concept of art, that is the principle that I wanted to express with this material, which in the end refers to everything, to all forms in the world. And not only to artistic forms, but also to social forms or legal forms or economic forms . . . All questions of man can be only a question of form, and that is the totalized concept of art.” 

 

Boldly, Buchloh ends up linking his premise to the Italian Futurism on the eve of  European Fascism, something that clearly influenced Beuys in his eyes. For the art historian, Walter Benjamin’s quote reveals the crypto-fascist nature of Futurism: 

 

“Fiat ars-pereat mundus, says Fascism, and, as [Filippo] Marinetti admits, expects war to supply the artistic gratification of a sense perception that has been changed by technology . . .  Mankind has reached such a degree of self-alienation that it can experience its own destruction as an esthetic pleasure of the first order. This is the situation of politics which fascism is rendering esthetic.” 

 

This process is what Benjamin calls the aestheticization of politics, that is, the spectacle of mass expression without real agency, and this would be the main ingredient of fascist regimes. The politization of aesthetics would be the opposite phenomenon, taking art not just as a cultural product, but as a cultural force. Benjamin posits that this would occur under Communism. Nearly ninety years after its publication, we have seen how such ambitious and probably ideal project has inevitably fallen into totalitarianism when applied to real-world situations. Explicit political art that supported the communist regimes ended up as a tool for the affirmation of the state, and not as the independent cultural force of its citizens exclusively. Under that binary, our constant longing for democracy is stronger than ever, as it seems to be the most efficient political framework allowing the vesting of power onto the people, that is, the state’s citizens, while facilitating their free aesthetic expression.    </p>

    <h2>Critical democracy </h2>
    <p>As it is well known, the concept of Democracy originates in Greece. Etymologically, the root “demos” means common people (originally, district), and “kratos” which would mean rule or strength.   </p>

 
 <p>
<b> Demos (δῆμος): </b> 

This word translates to "people" or "population." It refers to the citizens or the collective body of free and eligible individuals in a city-state or polis.  </p>

 <p><b> Kratos (κράτος): </b> 

This word translates to "power" or "rule." It denotes authority or governance.  </p>

 <p>Democracy then is understood as the government for the people by the people, where the power to make decisions is vested onto the people themselves, emphasising participation, equity and a voice in the decision making processes that affect their own lives. It is said that in such framework, the ultimate source of authority are the citizens, the ones that elect their own representatives through free elections. Yet issues arise in such paradigm once one realizes that “people” and “citizens” are not the same thing. In fact, when we trace back the history of Democracy and how it came to be in Grecce (mostly, in Athens) what we understand now of this political system apparently diverges from the Greek one. Politics as we know it also have its origins in ancient Greece: the actual etymology of the word is derived from "politikos" (πολιτικός), which in turn comes from "polis" (πόλις), meaning "city" or "city-state." So the term has to do with the organization and governance of the city-state, and, as such, would encompass social, civic, and public affairs. Yet it is a fact that Greek political thought sprouts from its aristocracy: not everyone living in the polis was a citizen, and, many times, the person, always a man with a good economic position, had a thorough background check where his ancestry was reviewed, and where immigrants, women, children and slaves could not partake in political life. In Athens, the principle of jus sanguinis was applied: both parents had to be born in the city in order to be able to have a saying in such democratic system. Participation in religious ceremonies was mandatory, so to demonstrate commitment to the city’s traditions and values, which in turn meant that there was no freedom of faith, and the cultural traditions followed needed to be that of the city state and no other one (or, at least, the main one). Citizenship also required to be part of the army in times of war, and this, plus the fulfillments of other various criteria, summed up, implied that Greek democracy was very limited in its inclusivity. One could go as far as to affirm that actual Greek democracy was not democratic at all, is we are going to make an equivalent of our current understanding of the concept. Which brings us back to the present democratic crisis, allowing us to wonder if what happens now, what Colin Crouch has defined as a state of  “Post-democracy,” is really a distortion of such political framework, or if it is a return to the original one implemented by the Greeks.

  <section id="section3">
    <h2>The apparent impossibility of a proper Democracy </h2>
    <p>Critics of the democratic system have existed since its origins in classical Greece: from Plato to Aristotle, the fear of the “tyranny of the majority” (for Aristotle, incarnated in the poor) potentially fooled and easily manipulated, mainly out of not being cultivated enough (nor wise enough, according to Plato) would either confront them against the rich so to send society into chaos, or would inevitably select someone unfit to rule, either with the same result, or falling towards totalitarianism. I will not delve into the many contemporary critics of democracy, except so to highlight Bernard Manin’s critique due to its relevance for what this text attains, a critique that asserts that, even if both representative (selecting someone to make decisions for a group of citizens) and direct democracies (where the citizens have their saying without representation) do promote the “rule of the people,” our current electoral systems has lead us to the inexorable rule of the aristocratic, of the oligarchy, of an economic elite. In order to counteract this issue, he puts forward the possibility of an applied direct democratic framework as the only viable alternative. I agree, to a certain extent. 

In any case, in that same line of critique, Colin Crouch indirectly acknowledges that Manin’s theoretical framework is a fact now, stating that political power has already fallen onto those elites now behind corporations that implement technocratic structures, and that this has limited the influence of ordinary citizens due to factors like the influence of money in politics or the choosing of unelected bodies by representatives making significant policy decisions. This current state of affairs is what he calls a “Post-democracy,” a state where all the formal institutions of democracy, such as elections, political parties, and representative government, are apparently maintained. However, their effectiveness and impact on decision-making are found to be diminished drastically, out of a decline in active citizen participation, a disenchantment from politics that sprouts of the feeling that their voices are not being heard, of an apathy seeded by the media itself, which has become another important Post-democratic, or even Anti-democratic agent… In his scheme, media concentration and manipulation (either by its private owners, or by the state) is a requirement in the maintaining of such status quo, thus influencing public opinion more than ever before. The democratic values, understood as power to the people, and a government for the people framed in a transparent, accountable, and responsible way, Crouch affirms, are being inevitably eroded away. Yet this does not seem hypothetical when we are currently experiencing this in most so-called democratic societies. I take it for a given fact then, so to start from there. My current research, presented now as a sketch, would like to aim towards the designing of a stop to such erosion progressively. Nevertheless, the causes for the degenerative process seem to be inscribed in representative democracy itself, in the line of Manin’s thesis.   

 

Hanzi Freinacht, a pen-name for Scandinavian duo Emil Ekner Friis, from Denmark, and Daniel Görtz, from Sweden, have devised a new philosophical framework that corresponds to the “digitalized, post-industrial, global age” explicitly contrasting it with modern and postmodern philosophies. They recognize that the modern philosophical framework is the general, mechanistic and reductionist worldview that is still mainstream in the West “and other developed societies” whereas postmodern philosophies, characterized by a critical stance towards knowledge and science, is more prevalent among the academia. While it recognizes that human minds come to be within power structures, unconscious drives, cognitive biases and arbitrary social constructions, all factors that make us “not as rational as we think,” the idealized narrative of progress, in practice, “often amounts to a more systematized oppression.” For this, they propose a Metamodern philosophy, a worldview “which combines the modern faith in progress with the postmodern critique” and that acknowledges people as being on a long developmental journey towards “greater complexity and existential depth.” They affirm that the core of this new philosophy would be counter-intuitive for modern and postmodern people alike. And this latter phrase, despite all the possible critiques that could be done out of some of their postulates, makes their framework appropriate for situating my own proposal at this point, given that I come from a country considered either non-Western, Westernized, or at the margins of the West (a developing country that has maintained much of its pre-Colonial knowledge systems alive, albeit transformed), yet I am writing from Scandinavia, permeated by the issues of the area I currently live in as well. This simultaneous positioning in two different locations is something that characterizes my proposal, but that is also key to understand that I am momentarily embracing their Metamodern philosophy as a strategy to shed light on the evident shifting from the Social Democratic values that they seem to champion, towards the previously discussed Post-Democratic state the new Right-wing government is implementing: both of their books “The Listening Society” and “The Nordic Ideology” revolve around the Nordic Social-Democratic idea of the Welfare state and what they call “Green Social Liberalism”, a social scheme that made their own ideas possible (what they call the Nordic “Meta-politics”) and yet is being progressively dismantled in Sweden, or, at the very least, is being rendered inaccessible to many.

    <h2>From Post-Democracy to Meta-Democracy </h2>
    <p> In "The Listening Society," Friss and Görtz affirm that there has been a transformative political revolution quietly unfolding in the Nordic countries, notably Scandinavia, challenging conventional notions of revolution by emphasizing non-violent, gradual changes in culturally and economically advanced regions where everything operates smoothly, such as the extreme order in Scandinavia. The authors argue that these nations, particularly Sweden, exhibit qualities of progressiveness despite not fitting the socialist utopian stereotype. By examining aspects like sustainability focus, refugee acceptance, and gender equality, they suggest that the Nordic countries exemplify a unique cultural progression, attributed to their stable development in a favorable global economic system, aligning with a trend towards more cosmopolitan values. The Nordic countries, for them, offer insight into global societal progression and the importance of stable conditions in fostering the changes that finally are expressed in their political landscape, an ideology they define as "Green Social Liberalism." The Nordics are presented as a unique case study where traditional political divisions have blurred, and parties, despite nominal adherence to different ideologies, share a common commitment to social liberalism including environmental concerns. So, despite the appearance of diversity, the Nordic countries, and especially Sweden, is characterized by a unified meta-ideology, creating a political environment where parties align more with each other than their counterparts in other countries. They effectively recognize the dominance of a singular meta-ideology, characterizing the Nordic political spectrum as a continuum of shared values challenging the traditional concept of a political center, asserting the prevalence of Green Social Liberalism. They explore the consequences of this ideological convergence, noting its impact on citizens' political engagement. The diminishing differences between political parties are seen as eroding the relevance of the traditional party system, prompting a search for alternative and more meaningful political participation. The need for new political engagement and ideological frameworks in this evolving landscape as liberal representative democracy has slowly rendered itself obsolete by getting close to its goal. As the Nordic countries are undergoing a significant transformation from a consensus-based system to a politics of co-development, with an increased demand for a more deliberative form of politics, this “holistic and deliberative forms” would be attained by becoming super-democratic (defined by avoiding manipulation, maintaining “healthy discourse, taking others’ perspectives, improving communication processes, getting the best possible science, representing the wider and more complex common good,” etc.) and by doing this, one would also challenge democracy in its current form. Thus, Meta-democracy is something like the democratic evaluation of democracy, and would be done according to these criteria:  </p> 

 <p>-better decision making  </p>

 <p>-greater collective intelligence  </p>

 <p>-public ownership of decisions  </p>

 <p>-compliance to rules and regulations  </p>

 <p>-efficacy  </p>

 <p>-transparency  </p>

 <p>-degree of inclusivity  </p>

 

 <p>Again, they have a point when they recognize that societies are getting more complex, that Modern democracies are unable to deal with these complexities, and that “the key self-organisational flow occurs on a much higher level.” In this framework, this inability is what makes the Modern democracies become Post-democracies. I agree. 

There are some grassroots proposals being developed that are closer to anarcho-communalism than the Social democratic scheme where Meta-democracy departs from. For example, what is known as Flatpack Democracy and particularly New Municipalism are all presented as governance innovations. And it is, at this point, that I have to acknowledge that I have discussed, in pretty much linear form, what it appears to be an historical progression that reflects a global shift. Nevertheless, all cases presented, including the apparently diverse citations at the start of this text, come from the monoculture of Western tradition, where these latter proposals are presented as breakthroughs, without taking into account other governance systems implemented elsewhere, beyond the limits of the West, that could be of extreme value. One of these is a resilient system of self-governance that emerged in the Andes thousands of years ago, that is based on redistribution and reciprocity, and that proved non-dependant on any central power. Interestingly enough, it originally depended on an administrative accounting device that was both network and database, just as the Blockchain technology, and that beautifully reflected the structure of the same social scheme whose data rested in its textile construction: the khipu.

    <h2>From cord to chain </h2>
    <p> Khipus (or quipus) are a fiber-based recording system known to be used by the Inca in pre-Columbian South America. The device consists of a series of strings, often having different colors and knots, typically made from cotton or animal fibers, that are attached to a main cord. Incas used khipus for various purposes, including record-keeping, accounting, and communication across their Empire. It is said that the knots and their position, even the position of the strings along the main cord conveyed different information such as numerical data and even narrative accounts. While some aspects of the khipu code have been deciphered, much about their precise encoding system and the data it contains has not.  

This textile technology was a crucial part of the Inca administrative and bureaucratic system, serving as a means of keeping records of various types,  used throughout the Inca Empire, which spanned a large part of South America before the arrival of the Spanish invasion in the 16th century.  Nevertheless, this type of textile technology is even older: its existence spreads for up to 5000 years, as a sample has been found buried in Caral. While the majority of information about khipus comes from the Inca civilization, there is evidence to suggest that the Wari civilization, which predated the Inca and was also located in the Andean region, used them as well. And its usage has not really died out: it is still being used today in certain parts of the Andes. 

In any case, we know more of Inca khipus than of any other type of khipu. Accounts from the Spanish chronicles regarding Inka record-keeping practices by means of the knotted string devices called khipu ("knot") indicate that these were compiled in a system of "checks and balances." Each community in the empire had a minimum of four khipu accountants, all of whom are said by the chronicler Garcilaso de la Vega to have kept the same records. Gary Urton, once the lead Khipu researcher, now vanished for sexual misconduct, examined several examples of matching khipu accounts identified among sets of two or three khipu. It is argued that certain three-term numerical sequences recorded in one set of three matching khipu from Chachapoyas, northern Peru, represent a type of numerical signifier that may have served as identity labels of the information recorded in this set of khipu. Garcilaso de la Vega, one of the first mestizo that wrote about the Incas, explained that the knotted-string devices known as khipu ("knot") were used in a system of checks and balances that involved having at least four quipucamayus (khipu-makers/keepers) in each village, regardless of its population size. What it is interesting is that these khipu-makers all kept the same records, emphasizing the importance of redundancy to avoid potential errors. Garcilaso suggested that having a sufficient number of khipu-makers in each village was preferable to prevent faults and errors in calculations, but also, the comparing of information among different records prevented it from being tampered, as if the information among these khipu backups was too different from each other, it would signal that something was wrong. So one could think of the khipus themselves as a part of a larger system, a social structure that would be embedded in the design of the khipu itself. The khipu, when in use by the Khipucamayoqs (the khipu keepers), would be both peer to peer network and database, just like is the case of the contemporary Blockchain technologies.

    <h2>From knot to block </h2>

<p> According to the Internet, a blockchain is a distributed and decentralized digital ledger that records transactions across a network of computers. It is designed to be secure, transparent, and tamper-resistant. The basic idea behind a blockchain is to create a chain of blocks, where each block contains a list of transactions. These blocks are linked together in a chronological and linear fashion, forming a chain. 

<p><b>  Decentralization:</b> </p> 

<p> Unlike traditional centralized databases, a blockchain is decentralized. It operates on a peer-to-peer network of computers (nodes), and each node has a copy of the entire blockchain. 

<p> <b> Blocks:</b> </p> 

<p> Transactions are grouped together into blocks. Each block contains a unique identifier called a cryptographic hash, a timestamp, and a reference to the previous block in the chain. </p> 

<p> <b> Cryptographic Hash:</b> </p> 

<p> A cryptographic hash is a unique string of characters generated by a mathematical algorithm. It serves as a digital fingerprint for the block. If the information in the block is altered, the hash changes, alerting the network to potential tampering. </p> 

<p><b>  Consensus Mechanism:</b> </p> 

<p> To validate and add a new block to the chain, there needs to be a consensus among the nodes in the network. Various consensus mechanisms, such as Proof of Work (used in Bitcoin) or Proof of Stake, are employed to achieve agreement on the validity of transactions. </p> 

<p><b>  Smart Contracts:</b> </p> 

<p> Some blockchains, like Ethereum, support smart contracts. These are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. Smart contracts automatically execute and enforce the terms when predefined conditions are met. </p> 

<p> <b> Nodes:</b> </p> 

<p> Nodes are individual computers connected to the blockchain network. They maintain a copy of the entire blockchain and participate in the validation and consensus process. </p> 

<p> <b> Distributed Ledger: </b></p> 

<p> The ledger, which contains all the transactions, is distributed across all nodes in the network. This distribution ensures that no single entity has control over the entire blockchain, enhancing security and resilience. </p> 

 

<p> <b> Smart Contracts:</b> </p> 

<p> Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with predefined rules. They automate the execution of contractual agreements when specified conditions are met. This feature can streamline complex processes and reduce the need for intermediaries. </p> 

<p><b>  Data Integrity: </b> </p> 

<p> Blockchain ensures the integrity of data by using consensus mechanisms to validate transactions. Once a block is added to the chain, it is cryptographically linked to the previous block, forming a secure and continuous record.Peer-to-Peer Network: </p> 

<p> The blockchain network operates as a peer-to-peer network, allowing nodes to communicate and reach consensus without the need for a central authority. </p> 

<p> By combining these components, a blockchain creates a transparent and secure record of transactions, resistant to fraud or unauthorized alterations. It has applications beyond cryptocurrencies, including supply chain management, voting systems, and more, where transparency, security, and decentralization are critical.”  When one thinks about the applications of blockchain technologies beyond cryptocurrencies, its potential as (self) governance tool, where self comes to mean “the people” becomes more clear, and yet, this is the branch in which it has been used the least. Departing from the khipu, a technology for social administration, I want to explore this possibility. But for this, one needs to understand how khipus would embed information in a network manner. </p> 
<p></p>

<p> According to Urton, what appears to be a straightforward example of a correlation of information registered on two different khipu occurs in the collection of the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) in New York. The provenance of these khipus was said to be near Callango, in the Ica Valley. The two samples in question, both made of cotton, bear the museum numbers 41.2/6702 and 41.2/6703. These khipu have been partially described in tabular format in Marcia and Robert Ascher's (1978) Code of the Quipu: Databook. In the Aschers' notational system, these two khipu are identified as AS194 and AS195. I will use the UR numeration, currently unused, just so the images can be understood.
<img src="https://autodios.github.io/media/lagunadeloscondores.png" alt="khipu">
The information recorded on one khipu is repeated on another. The fact that the color values associated with the series of numbers on these two khipu are not identical might indicate that the khipu keepers who constructed the two records had their individual color sign values for indicating some feature(s) of the identity of the numbers of objects, activities, etc., registered on their khipu. Urton has recognized this same phenomenon in other khipu, were parts of the data of one khipu was included in another. We can imagine how this data was copied over and over, partially or completely, not only in same size khipus, but in bigger, library-like khipus. That would serve to compile the information of a given time or area. But, as I mentioned before, the actual design of the khipu would reflect the physical distribution of the Inca administration.
