    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Art is political. This is a statement has permeated the imaginary of both artists and aesthetes, either by embracing it, or fervently questioning it. From Ingmar Bergman, making a parallel in between art, politics, and ethics, to Toni Morrison, who affirmed that the best art is political and beautiful at the same time, art, as long as it delves in the social, on issues related community as culture, is understood to be political.  

The current censoring of artists voicing opinions that do not sit well with certain powers, plus the placing of strategic figures (sometimes more linked with governments than art itself) in positions that can shape the trends of the art world, not only according to the taste of local governments, art dealers, or an sponsoring elite, but to seemingly specific global agendas, pressure us artists to acknowledge that abstaining for viewing our art as political, echoing Simone de Beauvoir, is a political act on itself.  

Although the linking of art and politics has been an open discussion for some time now, few artists have actually been as audacious as to recognized the political as an art on itself. For Joseph Beuys, the controversial German artist and known ex-Nazi, the concept of art had expanded to such a degree that it had colonized the separate realms of science and politics, and this was not surprising as “the scientific was originally contained in the artistic.” In fact, Beuys was convinced that “humankind will not survive without having realized the social body, the social order, into a kind of artwork.” Any of us could reshape society “as a sculpture,” that is, as art. Thus, everyone could be a politician-as-artist, as doing politics would be an art on itself.  

Yet critique has also been strong for the co-founder of the German green party and the creator of that “Social sculpture” concept: for Benjamin Buchloh, Beuys “misconception that politics could become a matter of aesthetics” fulfils the criteria for “the totalitarian in art.” This would be clearly expressed in Beuys following statement: 

 

“How I actually bring it as theory to the totalized concept of art, which means everything. The totalized concept of art, that is the principle that I wanted to express with this material, which in the end refers to everything, to all forms in the world. And not only to artistic forms, but also to social forms or legal forms or economic forms . . . All questions of man can be only a question of form, and that is the totalized concept of art.” 

 

Boldly, Buchloh ends up linking his premise to the Italian Futurism on the eve of  European Fascism, something that clearly influenced Beuys in his eyes. For the art historian, Walter Benjamin’s quote reveals the crypto-fascist nature of Futurism: 

 

“Fiat ars-pereat mundus, says Fascism, and, as [Filippo] Marinetti admits, expects war to supply the artistic gratification of a sense perception that has been changed by technology . . .  Mankind has reached such a degree of self-alienation that it can experience its own destruction as an esthetic pleasure of the first order. This is the situation of politics which fascism is rendering esthetic.” 

 

This process is what Benjamin calls the aestheticization of politics, that is, the spectacle of mass expression without real agency, and this would be the main ingredient of fascist regimes. The politization of aesthetics would be the opposite phenomenon, taking art not just as a cultural product, but as a cultural force. Benjamin posits that this would occur under Communism. Nearly ninety years after its publication, we have seen how such ambitious and probably ideal project has inevitably fallen into totalitarianism when applied to real-world situations. Explicit political art that supported the communist regimes ended up as a tool for the affirmation of the state, and not as the independent cultural force of its citizens exclusively. Under that binary, our constant longing for democracy is stronger than ever, as it seems to be the most efficient political framework allowing the vesting of power onto the people, that is, the state’s citizens, while facilitating their free aesthetic expression.    </p>

    <h2>Critical democracy </h2>
    <p>As it is well known, the concept of Democracy originates in Greece. Etymologically, the root “demos” means common people (originally, district), and “kratos” which would mean rule or strength.  

 

Demos (δῆμος): 

This word translates to "people" or "population." It refers to the citizens or the collective body of free and eligible individuals in a city-state or polis. 

Kratos (κράτος): 

This word translates to "power" or "rule." It denotes authority or governance. 

Democracy then is understood as the government for the people by the people, where the power to make decisions is vested onto the people themselves, emphasising participation, equity and a voice in the decision making processes that affect their own lives. It is said that in such framework, the ultimate source of authority are the citizens, the ones that elect their own representatives through free elections. Yet issues arise in such paradigm once one realizes that “people” and “citizens” are not the same thing. In fact, when we trace back the history of Democracy and how it came to be in Grecce (mostly, in Athens) what we understand now of this political system apparently diverges from the Greek one. Politics as we know it also have its origins in ancient Greece: the actual etymology of the word is derived from "politikos" (πολιτικός), which in turn comes from "polis" (πόλις), meaning "city" or "city-state." So the term has to do with the organization and governance of the city-state, and, as such, would encompass social, civic, and public affairs. Yet it is a fact that Greek political thought sprouts from its aristocracy: not everyone living in the polis was a citizen, and, many times, the person, always a man with a good economic position, had a thorough background check where his ancestry was reviewed, and where immigrants, women, children and slaves could not partake in political life. In Athens, the principle of jus sanguinis was applied: both parents had to be born in the city in order to be able to have a saying in such democratic system. Participation in religious ceremonies was mandatory, so to demonstrate commitment to the city’s traditions and values, which in turn meant that there was no freedom of faith, and the cultural traditions followed needed to be that of the city state and no other one (or, at least, the main one). Citizenship also required to be part of the army in times of war, and this, plus the fulfillments of other various criteria, summed up, implied that Greek democracy was very limited in its inclusivity. One could go as far as to affirm that actual Greek democracy was not democratic at all, is we are going to make an equivalent of our current understanding of the concept. Which brings us back to the present democratic crisis, allowing us to wonder if what happens now, what Colin Crouch has defined as a state of  “Post-democracy,” is really a distortion of such political framework, or if it is a return to the original one implemented by the Greeks.

    <h2>The apparent impossibility of a proper Democracy </h2>
    <p>Critics of the democratic system have existed since its origins in classical Greece: from Plato to Aristotle, the fear of the “tyranny of the majority” (for Aristotle, incarnated in the poor) potentially fooled and easily manipulated, mainly out of not being cultivated enough (nor wise enough, according to Plato) would either confront them against the rich so to send society into chaos, or would inevitably select someone unfit to rule, either with the same result, or falling towards totalitarianism. I will not delve into the many contemporary critics of democracy, except so to highlight Bernard Manin’s critique due to its relevance for what this text attains, a critique that asserts that, even if both representative (selecting someone to make decisions for a group of citizens) and direct democracies (where the citizens have their saying without representation) do promote the “rule of the people,” our current electoral systems has lead us to the inexorable rule of the aristocratic, of the oligarchy, of an economic elite. In order to counteract this issue, he puts forward the possibility of an applied direct democratic framework as the only viable alternative. I agree, to a certain extent. 

In any case, in that same line of critique, Colin Crouch indirectly acknowledges that Manin’s theoretical framework is a fact now, stating that political power has already fallen onto those elites now behind corporations that implement technocratic structures, and that this has limited the influence of ordinary citizens due to factors like the influence of money in politics or the choosing of unelected bodies by representatives making significant policy decisions. This current state of affairs is what he calls a “Post-democracy,” a state where all the formal institutions of democracy, such as elections, political parties, and representative government, are apparently maintained. However, their effectiveness and impact on decision-making are found to be diminished drastically, out of a decline in active citizen participation, a disenchantment from politics that sprouts of the feeling that their voices are not being heard, of an apathy seeded by the media itself, which has become another important Post-democratic, or even Anti-democratic agent… In his scheme, media concentration and manipulation (either by its private owners, or by the state) is a requirement in the maintaining of such status quo, thus influencing public opinion more than ever before. The democratic values, understood as power to the people, and a government for the people framed in a transparent, accountable, and responsible way, Crouch affirms, are being inevitably eroded away. Yet this does not seem hypothetical when we are currently experiencing this in most so-called democratic societies. I take it for a given fact then, so to start from there. My current research, presented now as a sketch, would like to aim towards the designing of a stop to such erosion progressively. Nevertheless, the causes for the degenerative process seem to be inscribed in representative democracy itself, in the line of Manin’s thesis.   

 

Hanzi Freinacht, a pen-name for Scandinavian duo Emil Ekner Friis, from Denmark, and Daniel Görtz, from Sweden, have devised a new philosophical framework that corresponds to the “digitalized, post-industrial, global age” explicitly contrasting it with modern and postmodern philosophies. They recognize that the modern philosophical framework is the general, mechanistic and reductionist worldview that is still mainstream in the West “and other developed societies” whereas postmodern philosophies, characterized by a critical stance towards knowledge and science, is more prevalent among the academia. While it recognizes that human minds come to be within power structures, unconscious drives, cognitive biases and arbitrary social constructions, all factors that make us “not as rational as we think,” the idealized narrative of progress, in practice, “often amounts to a more systematized oppression.” For this, they propose a Metamodern philosophy, a worldview “which combines the modern faith in progress with the postmodern critique” and that acknowledges people as being on a long developmental journey towards “greater complexity and existential depth.” They affirm that the core of this new philosophy would be counter-intuitive for modern and postmodern people alike. And this latter phrase, despite all the possible critiques that could be done out of some of their postulates, makes their framework appropriate for situating my own proposal at this point, given that I come from a country considered either non-Western, Westernized, or at the margins of the West (a developing country that has maintained much of its pre-Colonial knowledge systems alive, albeit transformed), yet I am writing from Scandinavia, permeated by the issues of the area I currently live in as well. This simultaneous positioning in two different locations is something that characterizes my proposal, but that is also key to understand that I am momentarily embracing their Metamodern philosophy as a strategy to shed light on the evident shifting from the Social Democratic values that they seem to champion, towards the previously discussed Post-Democratic state the new Right-wing government is implementing: both of their books “The Listening Society” and “The Nordic Ideology” revolve around the Nordic Social-Democratic idea of the Welfare state and what they call “Green Social Liberalism”, a social scheme that made their own ideas possible (what they call the Nordic “Meta-politics”) and yet is being progressively dismantled in Sweden, or, at the very least, is being rendered inaccessible to many.
